# How to use

1. Install [OBS-VirtualCam](https://github.com/Fenrirthviti/obs-virtual-cam/releases) and enable it.
2. Run this program and from settings select "OBS-Camera" as the video device.
3. Test if the last Val text is detected, if yes skip to step: 7
4. Record a statue run
5. Save a frame directly from the recording, that has the last Val text on screen (for example VLC lets you to save currect frame under the "Video" menu)
6. Open the image in editor of your choice and then crop the image, make everything else transparent but the text and save the image as templateimage.png to the testdata folder.
7. Fiddle with the settings, cropping the video to have the game only probably increases performance a bit (templateimage needs to fit in or else the program crashes), set the delays to your liking, it might take a bit to have the beep play at correct time, also match the max fps with the video feed fps.
8. Play & enjoy perfect val leaves everytime.
